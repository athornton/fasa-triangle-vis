# Plotly-based Visualization of The Triangle

The Triangle is a region of space in the Star Trek Universe (FASA map).

This is a visualization of the systems within it.  Run it in a
JupyterLab environment with Plotly and Pandas installed.

Clicking the button immediately below will take you to a Binder site
that will do exactly that, if you don't happen to have JupyterLab at
hand.
